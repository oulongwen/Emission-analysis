This notebook analyzes the EPAct/V2/E-89
dataset(https://www.epa.gov/moves/epactv2e-89-tier-2-gasoline-fuel-effects-study)
to:
1. Understand the effect of fuel ethanol content on PM emission;
2. Build a model to predict PM emission from fuel properties. The model should
   be interpretable (linear models are preferred).
   The data included in this repo are not the original data file. They have
   been preprocessed to facilitate the analysis.
